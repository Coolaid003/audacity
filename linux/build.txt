Instructions for Building on Linux

Fuller instructions can be found on our wiki at http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Building_On_Linux.

In fact you should read those instructions rather than these 
once.  These ones give less detail.


Some prerequisites:

- Audacity requires gcc 4.9 or later to build.

- CMake ( http://www.cmake.org/ ) is required to build the local copy of 
  the libsoxr resampling library used by Audacity.

On a modern Debian distro, e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 (bionic), you would do:

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake

- libasound and gtk are required. Having gtk2 and gtk3 too  
  may not be required, but compilation works if both are.

- Auto-tools are also needed.

sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake

- Since you will be fetching code from git repositories you 
  will need git.

sudo apt-get install git git-gui gitk


wxWidgets:

 1) Clone wxWidgets and checkout 3.1.3 from the Audacity fork of the 
    wxWidgets project: 
       https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/....

    for example
      mkdir ./wxWidgets
      cd ./wxWidgets
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/

    Don't be tempted to use Widgets already installed on Linux because this 
    will typically be a different version and will cause problems.              

    IF you forgot the --recurse-submodules, you can correct that later by:
      git submodule update --init

  2) Follow instructions for building at 
    https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/blob/audacity-fixes-3.1.3/docs/gtk/install.md

    So...

    mkdir buildgtk
    cd buildgtk
    ../configure --with-gtk
    make
    su <type root password>
    make install
    ldconfig    

  3) Having got this far, it is well worth trying out building some wxWidgets
    examples to confirm that building has worked OK
    For testing the installation follow the instruction below.

    Check the version you have installed on your machine
    	wx-config --version
    
    1. Sample testing - The source code for samples lives in sample subdir of 
       source dir & makefiles are in buildgtk/samples
       So, to build 'minimal':
       
       cd ~/<path>/buildgtk/samples/minimal
       make
       ./minimal

   2. Building apps with wxWidgets
   	Go to https://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/overview_helloworld.html and 
	clone the source code of the Hello World Example to a file having a 
	.cpp extenstion (eg. hello.cpp).

	Now to build this app

	g++ hello.cp `wx-config --cxflags --libs` -o hello

	above command will compile hello.cpp and create a binary called 'hello'.

   *  Runnig the app
   	./hello
   	If your get an error while running the app like:
	
	hello.out: error while loading shared libraries: libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
	
	Write the following to your ~/.bashrc file

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

Audacity:

See our wiki for more detailed build instructions, including how to 
install CMake.


1. Make a build directory under the audacity git directory.

  cd audacity
  mkdir build-cmake
  cd build-cmake


2. Generate the makefiles

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

3. Build Audacity 

  cmake --build . 

4. Run

  cd bin/Release
  ./audacity
