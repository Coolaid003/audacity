At this time, the newest SDK version that Audacity can be build with is 10.6. 
To build Audacity using Xcode 5.1 or newer, you need to extract the 10.6 SDK 
from an earlier version of Xcode.

In the instructions below, Xcode 4.3.3 (for the 10.6 SDK) and Xcode 5.1.1 will 
be used.  Xcode 6.1.1, 6.3, 6.4.1, 7.0, and 7.2 have been verified to work as well.

1) Download Xcode 5.1.1 or greater and install it to /Applications
   https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12

2) Download Xcode 4.3.3 and open it in Finder
3) Right click the "Xcode.app" bundle and select "Show Package Contents"
4) Navigate down the directories to get to:

   Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/

5) Copy the MacOSX10.6.sdk folder to:

   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/

   Xcode is now ready.

6) Download wxWidgets.  We currently require version 3.0.2, which can be downloaded from:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.2/wxWidgets-3.0.2.tar.bz2

   IMPORTANT: Don't use wxWidgets from a package manager! It will have a wrong setup 
              and end with errors while compiling.

7) Once the download is complete, untar it (your browser may have already done this):

   tar xf wxWidgets-3.0.2.tar.bz2

8) Apply the following fixes to wxWidgets:

   cd wxWidgets-3.0.2
   patch -p0 -i <path to Audacity source>/mac/wxMac_additions/wxMac-3.0.2-fixes.patch

9) And finally build/install wxWidgets:

   sudo <path to Audacity source>/mac/build_wxwidgets

You should now be able to build Audacity using either the xcodebuild command line tool
(below El Capitan):

   cd <path to Audacity source>
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

or the Xcode application:

   open <path to Audacity source>/mac/Audacity.xcodeproj

(10) If you need Audacity to use languages other than English, then you'll have to install
the gettext suite of tools (to get the msgfmt command).  The source can be downloaded from:

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/gettext-latest.tar.gz

Untar it:

   tar xf gettext-latest.tar.gz

And install:

   cd gexttext-latest
   ./configure
   sudo make install

El Capitan) Configure uses llvm and has several errors with compiler directives. You
            should use the Xcode project in this case.

   IMPORTANT: Don't do the recommended changes by Xcode. It will change your setup to 
              64 bit (conflict with Quicktime in wxWidgets) and newest OS as target 
              platform, which has to be 10.6.

   IMPORTANT: Mac OSX 10.11 El Capitan needs crt1.o and dylib1.o for compiling. Either 
              you add '-L/usr/lib' AT THE END of WX_LDFLAGS (Debug and Release) in 
              Build Settings in Xcode or you copy them to you 10.6 SDK folder:

   cp /usr/lib/crt1.o /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/lib
   cp /usr/lib/dylib1.o /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/lib
